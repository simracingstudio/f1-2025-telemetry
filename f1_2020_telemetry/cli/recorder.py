"""This script captures F1 2019 telemetry packets (sent over UDP) and stores them into SQLite3 database files.

One database file will contain all packets from one session.

From UDP packet to database entry
---------------------------------

The data flow of UDP packets into the database is managed by 2 threads.

PacketReceiver thread:

  (1) The PacketReceiver thread does a select() to wait on incoming packets in the UDP socket.
  (2) When woken up with the notification that a UDP packet is available for reading, it is actually read from the socket.
  (3) The receiver thread calls the recorder_thread.record_packet() method with a TimedPacket containing
      the reception timestamp and the packet just read.
  (4) The recorder_thread.record_packet() method locks its packet queue, inserts the packet there,
      then unlocks the queue. Note that this method is only called from within the receiver thread!
  (5) repeat from (1).

PacketRecorder thread:

  (1) The PacketRecorder thread sleeps for a given period, then wakes up.
  (2) It locks its packet queue, moves the queue's packets to a local variable, empties the packet queue,
      then unlocks the packet queue.
  (3) The packets just moved out of the queue are passed to the 'process_incoming_packets' method.
  (4) The 'process_incoming_packets' method inspects the packet headers, and converts the packet data
      into SessionPacket instances that are suitable for inserting into the database.
      In the process, it collects packets from the same session. After collecting all
      available packets from the same session, it passed them on to the
      'process_incoming_same_session_packets' method.
  (5) The 'process_incoming_same_session_packets' method makes sure that the appropriate SQLite database file
      is opened (i.e., the one with matching sessionUID), then writes the packets into the 'packets' table.

By decoupling the packet capture and database writing in different threads, we minimize the risk of
dropping UDP packets. This risk is real because SQLite3 database commits can take a considerable time.
